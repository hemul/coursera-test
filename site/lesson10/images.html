        who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of
        deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred
        by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there
        is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends
        himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the
        worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
        timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.&quot;
